== Kaplay.js 行为准则 ==
=============================================================================

这份文档规定了参与Kaplay.js社区应遵守的行为准则和规范。

行为准则对开源社区至关重要，它就像是一个游乐场的规则牌，确保所有人都能在一个友好、
尊重和包容的环境中一起工作和交流。

主要内容包括：

1. 社区承诺
   - 社区成员承诺为所有人创造无骚扰的体验
   - 承诺以开放、友好和健康的方式互动

2. 行为标准
   - 积极行为的例子：表现同理心、尊重不同意见、接受建设性反馈等
   - 不可接受行为的例子：性别歧视、人身攻击、骚扰、泄露隐私等

3. 执行责任
   - 社区领导者负责澄清和执行行为标准
   - 有权移除不符合行为准则的内容并采取适当措施

对小朋友来说，可以这样理解：
这就像是"游戏规则"，告诉大家怎样友好地一起玩游戏。好的玩家会关心别人的感受，
尊重不同意见，承认自己的错误；而不友好的行为，比如嘲笑别人、说难听的话、泄露别人的秘密，
都是不被允许的。这样大家才能开心地一起创造更棒的游戏！
